								<h2>General Research Interests</h2>
								<p>Adaptation, gene flow, comparative genomics, genome organization, bioinformatics</p>
								<p align="justify">In particular, I am interested in the evolution of hierarchically structured populations exhibiting extensive gene flow and the inferences available regarding evolutionary and demographic processes from genetic data under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. How do evolutionary processes influence the genetic and genomic architectures of complex traits? How does the genetic and genomic architecture influence resilience to change? How does adaptation influence, and how is it influenced by, recombination rate evolution - are their feedbacks? How do these patterns and processes differ across closely related species/genera? What are the implications of these findings to future analyses to uncover the loci underlying adaptive traits, as well as to conservation, industry, the economy, and our overall understanding of evolution across taxa? How can we improve the way in which we communicate our understanding to the public?</p>

							<h3><p align="justify"><a href="http://coadaptree.forestry.ubc.ca">CoAdapTree</a></h3>
							Currently I am a postdoc at the University of British Columbia working on the <a href="http://coadaptree.forestry.ubc.ca">CoAdapTree project</a> with Sally Aitken. This project examines how biotic (eg pathogens) and abiotic (eg climate) factors influence genomic variation across four conifer species. My primary responsibilities focus on the adaptive genetics of drought and cold hardiness in 70 Douglas-fir and 87 western Larch populations, as well as climate adaptation in these two species, lodgepole pine, and jack pine. To handle all of this data, and to do so with reproducibility in mind, I've made my bioinformatics pipeline <a href="https://www.github.com/coadaptree/poolseq_pipeline">publically available</a>. Using a comparative genomics approach we will be able to leverage these species to further validate adaptive loci that would otherwise have less certainty in being a true adaptive component. High levels of certainty are of particular importance when designing genetic capture arrays for use in breeding and restoration. We will then validate genomics-informed breeding strategies for Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine for incorporating vulnerability of forward selections to climatic events and pathogens. Below are some of the manuscripts that have come from my work with CoAdapTree.</p>
							
							<h3>Evaluating genomic data for management of local adaptation in a changing climate <a href="../cv/Mahoney_et_al_2019_Evaluating_genomic_data_for_management_of_local_adaptation_in_a_changing_climate_A_lodgepole_pine_case_study.pdf"><font color="blue">PDF</font></a></h3>
							<p align="justify">Understanding how managed populations are adapted to their local environments will assist in both breeding and reforestation efforts by identifying environmental sources driving trait differentiation and pathogen susceptibility. To feasibly (weighing time, effort, and cost) disect these aspects of plant biology, there are a few common approaches that can be considered, but do they hold the same information content with regard to the environmental drivers of differentiation or the spatial scale of adaptation? To address this, we compared climate data, genomic data, and a long term provinance trial in lodgepole pine in this regard. We discuss relative strengths and weaknesses when considering the appropriate data for managing populations with broad geographic ranges. (see figure to the left showing range-wide clines in genomic regions underlying adaptation)</a></p>

							<h3>Evolutionary genomics of the invasive and defoliating gypsy moth <a href="../cv/pdfs/Friedline_et_al-2019-Evolutionary_genomics_of_gypsy_moth_populations_sampled_along_a_latitudinal_gradient-Molecular_Ecology.pdf"><font color="blue">PDF</font></a></h3>
							<p align="justify">Biological invasions from non-native species can have have large economic consequences and can fundamentally alter the ecology of the invaded system. As one such example, the European gypsy moth was introduced to the eastern United States around the late 19th century and has since spread north through Maine, west through Wisconsin, and south through the Carolinas. Consequently, the gypsy moth has become one of the most destructive hardwood pests in North America. To understand how this species has been so successful in a novel environment we sampled populations from the range edges by examining genomic variation underlying trait differentiation for three developmental traits. We described how the invasion was facilitated through adaptive variation found throughout the genome and that genomic patterns (ie linkage disequilibrium) among adaptive genetic componants were driving differences in the three traits among populations.</p><br />
							<h3>Effects of Forest Management on Fine-scale Gene Flow in a Fire-suppressed population of <i>Pinus lambertiana</i> Dougl. <a href="../cv/pdfs/Lind_et_al_2019_Effect_of_fire_and_thinning_on_file-scale_genetic_structre_and_gene_flow_in_fire-suppressed_populations_of_sugar_pine_Forest_Ecology_And_Management.pdf"><font color="blue">PDF</font></a></h3>

							<p align="justify">Climate change is exacerbating the effects of fire suppression in the west, and prescribed fire and forest thinning are two ways of mitigating these effects. Sugar pine is an important species in these forests, and was historically dominant before fire suppression. We looked at how these treatments affect mating patterns in this species and discuss how this may affect long-term forest dynamics. (see 3D stem map to the left; more about Teakettle Experimental Forest <a href="../teakettle/teakettle.html">here</a>).</p>

							<h3>Local adaptation of <i>Pinus albicaulis</i> Engelm. across fine spatial scales of the Lake Tahoe Basin - <a href="../cv/pdfs/Lind_et_al_2017_Water-availability-drives-signatures-of-local-adaptation-in-whitebark-pine-across-fine-spatial-scales-of-the-lake-tahoe-basin_Molecular_ecology.pdf"><font color="blue">PDF</font></a></h3><br>
							Whitebark pine is a foundational species in many high elevation forests and plays an important role in ecosystem function and services. Despite its influential role in these systems, whitebark pine is listed as a threatened species by IUCN. Therefore, understanding the spatial scale of adaptation in this species is vital for conservation efforts. Even so, much of our knowledge regarding adaptation in trees comes from broad geographic ranges, often beyond the scale at which most forest management is applied. Using a common garden we found that whitebark pine is adapted across the fine spatial scales of the Lake Tahoe Basin despite highly shared genetic variation across populations. We further showed that the adaptive signal driven by water availability is apparent across common garden and genomicw data, likely due to the rain shadow on the eastern Siera Nevada. (to the left see map of sampled populations from the Lake Tahoe Basin, and how quickly the rainshadow reduces annual preciptation by 50% in just under 15 miles)<br />

							<h3>Linkage maps and the genomic architecture of local adaptation</h3><br>
							For non-model organisms, genomic resources needed to fully describe the genetic architecture of complex traits can face many hurdles. Because of their large genome size, conifers face many challenges in this regard, particularly with respect to the production of physical sequence maps with ordered genetic markers. Such resources can be used to test fundamental theory regarding the expected genetic architecture underlying adaptive traits under various demographic and evolutionary scenarios. To produce such resources, linkage maps are often used to both order and elongate blocks of sequence data. Across taxa, such maps were predominately made from well understood familial relationships or mating designs, but maps of single trees began increasing in numbers in the 1990s. In conifers, maternally derived haploid tissue (i.e., a single copy of the genome from megagametophye tissue) can be used to order markers within individual trees within a fairly straightforward framework. To begin to test fundamental theories of local adaptation in a non-model conifer, <i>Pinus balfouriana</i>, we constructed a <a href="https://treegenesdb.org/cmap?id=15">dense linkage map</a> using individuals collected from populations that historically exhibited gene flow but have subsequently become isolated from one another since the last glacial maximum. <a href="../cv/pdfs/Friedline_et_al_2015_The-genetic-architecture-of-local-adaptation-I--the-genomic-landscape-of-foxtail-pine-as-revealed-from-a-high-density-linkage-map_Tree_genetics_and_genomes.pdf"><font color="blue">PDF</font></a><br />
							<br />
							After completing this linkage map, we used niche modeling and indirect measures of WUE, the ratio of carbon isotopes fixed during photosynthesis (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C), as well as nutrient utilization, the ratio of nitrogen isotopes fixed during leaf-level resource utilization (μgN), to explore the importance of water availability as a determinant of geographical range of foxtail pine. Additionally, we explored the degree to which variation in &delta;<sup>13</sup>C and μgN is genetically based, differentiated among populations, and underlain by a genetic architecture with large effect loci. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/01/29/038240.full.pdf"><font color="blue">PDF</font></a><br />
